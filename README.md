Description of week 2: Python

## Python Variables
- Variables are containers for storing data values
- Python has no command for declaring a variable.
- A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
   - *Example* : first_name = "Meghana"
- Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
   - *Example* : x=2 # x is type of int,
   -  x= "python" # x is now type of str
   
**Get the Type**
- You can get the data type of a variable with type() function.
   - *Example* : last_name = "Aenugu"
   - To get the type of last_name, print(type(last_name))
- You can get the input from the user using input() function
   - *Example* : dob= input (print("Please ,enter your dob))
